**Chapter: Plant Reproduction**

**Q1. What is sexual reproduction in plants?**  
A: Sexual reproduction in plants involves the fusion of male and female reproductive cells to produce a new plant. It usually occurs through flowers, where pollen from the male part (stamen) fertilizes the ovule in the female part (carpel).

**Q2. What is dispersal of seeds? Why is it important?**  
A: Dispersal of seeds is the process by which seeds are spread away from the parent plant. It is important because it prevents overcrowding, allows plants to grow in new places, and increases their chances of survival.

**Q3. Explain the methods of seed dispersal?**  
A: Seeds are dispersed by various methods such as:
- **Dispersal by Wind** – Some seeds are very light and have special structures like wings or hair-like fibers that help them float in the air and get carried by the wind.  
   *Examples:* Dandelion, Cotton, Maple seeds.
- **Dispersal by Water** – Seeds of plants that grow near or in water have a waterproof outer covering, which helps them float and travel through water to new places.  
   *Examples:* Coconut, Lotus, Water lily.
- **Dispersal by Animals** – Animals help in seed dispersal in two ways:  
   - Some seeds have hooks or sticky surfaces that attach to the fur of animals and are carried away. *Example:* Xanthium (burdock).  
   - Some seeds are found inside fruits, and when animals eat the fruit, they drop the seeds in different places. *Examples:* Mango, Guava, Cherry.
- **Dispersal by Explosion (Self-dispersal)** – Some plants have seed pods that dry up and burst open suddenly, scattering the seeds in different directions.  
   *Examples:* Pea, Balsam, Poppy.

**Q4. What is vegetative reproduction?**  
A: Vegetative reproduction is a type of asexual reproduction where new plants grow from parts of the parent plant such as roots, stems, or leaves. Examples include potato (from stem tubers) and onion (from bulbs).
 
**Chapter: Light and Shadows**

**Q5. What are the properties of light?**  
A: Light has the following properties:
1. It travels in a straight line.
2. It can be reflected.
3. It can pass through transparent objects.
4. It helps us see things.

**Q6. Define transparent, translucent, and opaque objects with examples.**  
A:
- **Transparent objects** allow light to pass through them completely (e.g., glass, clear plastic).
- **Translucent objects** allow some light to pass through but not clearly (e.g., frosted glass, butter paper).
- **Opaque objects** do not allow any light to pass through (e.g., wood, metal).

**Q7. How are shadows formed?**  
A: Shadows are formed when an opaque object blocks the path of light. The shape and size of the shadow depend on the position of the light source and the object.

**Q8. How does the size of a shadow change during the day?**  
A: Shadows are longest in the morning and evening when the sun is low. They are shortest at noon when the sun is directly overhead.

**Q9. Explain the formation of day and night.**  
A: Day and night occur due to the rotation of the Earth. The side of the Earth facing the Sun has daytime, while the opposite side has nighttime.

**Q10. What is an eclipse? Explain the types of eclipses.**  
A: An eclipse occurs when one celestial body blocks the light of another. There are two types:
1. **Solar Eclipse**: When the Moon comes between the Sun and the Earth, blocking sunlight.
2. **Lunar Eclipse**: When the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight from reaching the Moon.
 
**Chapter: Simple Machines**

**Q11. What are simple machines?**  
A: Simple machines are tools that make work easier by reducing the effort needed to perform a task. Examples include levers, pulleys, and inclined planes.

**Q12. What is the difference between simple and complex machines?**  
A:
- **Simple machines** have few or no moving parts (e.g., scissors, hammer).
- **Complex machines** are made up of two or more simple machines (e.g., washing machine, clock).

**Q13. What are the six types of simple machines?**  
A: The six types of simple machines are:
1. **Lever** – A lever is a rigid rod that moves around a fixed point called a fulcrum. It helps lift or move heavy objects using less effort. Examples: see-saw, scissors, crowbar.
2. **Pulley** – A pulley consists of a wheel with a groove in which a rope or chain runs. It is used to lift heavy loads easily by changing the direction of force. Examples: well pulley, flagpole pulley.
3. **Inclined Plane** – A sloping surface that helps move heavy objects upwards with less effort. Instead of lifting, we can slide objects up or down. Examples: ramps, slides.
4. **Wheel and Axle** – A wheel attached to a rod (axle) that helps move objects easily by reducing friction. Examples: bicycle wheels, doorknobs.
5. **Wedge** – A wedge has a sharp edge and is used to cut or split objects apart. It applies force to a small area to increase pressure. Examples: knife, axe, nail.
6. **Screw** – A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. It is used to hold things tightly together or lift heavy loads. Examples: screws, jar lids, drill bits.

**Q14. What is a lever? What are its parts?**  
A: A lever is a rigid rod that moves around a fixed point called the fulcrum. It has three parts:
- **Fulcrum (F)**: The fixed point around which the lever moves.
- **Load (L)**: The object on which work is done.
- **Effort (E)**: The force applied to move the load.

**Q15. What are the types of levers? Give examples.**  
A: Levers are of three types:
1. **Class 1 Lever**: The fulcrum is between the effort and load (e.g., see-saw, scissors).
2. **Class 2 Lever**: The load is between the fulcrum and effort (e.g., wheelbarrow, bottle opener).
3. **Class 3 Lever**: The effort is between the fulcrum and load (e.g., fishing rod, tongs).

**Q16. What is a pulley? What are its types?**  
A: A pulley is a wheel with a groove that helps lift objects. Types include:
- **Fixed Pulley**: Used to draw water from wells.
- **Movable Pulley**: Used to lift heavy loads in construction.

**Q17. What is a screw? Give two uses.**  
A: A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. It is used to hold objects together (e.g., screws in furniture) and to lift heavy objects (e.g., screw jack).

**Q18. Mention some uses of pulleys.**  
A: Pulleys are used in:
- Drawing water from wells
- Raising flags
- Lifting heavy loads in cranes
