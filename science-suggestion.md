### **Chapter: Plant Reproduction**

#### **1. What is sexual reproduction in plants?**  
Sexual reproduction in plants happens when male and female parts of a flower join together to form seeds.

#### **2. What is dispersal of seeds?**  
Dispersal of seeds is the process by which seeds are spread away from the parent plant by wind, water, animals, or explosion.

#### **3. What is vegetative reproduction?**  
Vegetative reproduction is a type of plant reproduction where new plants grow from parts like roots, stems, and leaves instead of seeds.

### **Chapter: Light and Shadows**

#### **1. What are the properties of light?**  
- Light travels in a straight line.  
- Light helps us see objects.  
- Light can be reflected.  
- Light can pass through some materials.  

#### **2. Define transparent, translucent, and opaque objects.**  
- **Transparent objects** allow light to pass through them (e.g., glass).  
- **Translucent objects** allow some light to pass through (e.g., frosted glass).  
- **Opaque objects** do not allow light to pass through (e.g., wood).  

#### **3. How is a shadow formed?**  
A shadow is formed when an opaque object blocks light, preventing it from passing through.

#### **4. How is day and night formed?**  
Day and night are formed because the Earth rotates from west to east. The part of the Earth facing the Sun has day, while the part away from the Sun has night.

#### **5. What is an eclipse?**  
An eclipse occurs when one heavenly body comes between another and blocks light.  

#### **6. What is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?**  
- **Solar eclipse** occurs when the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth, blocking sunlight.  
- **Lunar eclipse** occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon.  

### **Chapter: Simple Machines**

#### **1. What is a simple machine?**  
A simple machine is a device that makes work easier by using a single force.

#### **2. What are some examples of simple machines?**  
Examples include scissors, pulleys, levers, and wedges.

#### **3. What is the difference between simple and complex machines?**  
- **Simple machines** have few or no moving parts (e.g., knife, pulley).  
- **Complex machines** are made of two or more simple machines (e.g., washing machine, clock).  

#### **4. What is a lever?**  
A lever is a rigid rod that moves around a fixed point called the fulcrum.

#### **5. What are the three types of levers?**  
- **Class 1 lever:** The fulcrum is between the effort and the load (e.g., see-saw, scissors).  
- **Class 2 lever:** The load is between the fulcrum and effort (e.g., wheelbarrow, nutcracker).  
- **Class 3 lever:** The effort is between the fulcrum and load (e.g., fishing rod, broom).  

#### **6. What is a pulley?**  
A pulley is a wheel with a groove and a rope that helps lift objects.

#### **7. What are the uses of pulleys?**  
- Drawing water from wells.  
- Raising or lowering flags.  
- Lifting heavy loads.  

#### **8. What is a screw? Give two uses.**  
A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.  
**Uses:**  
- Holding things together.  
- Lifting heavy objects (screw-jack).
