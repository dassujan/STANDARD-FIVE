### **Chapter: Plant Reproduction**  

#### **1. What is sexual reproduction in plants?**  
**Answer:** Sexual reproduction in plants is the process where new plants are formed from seeds. It involves the fusion of male and female reproductive parts found in flowers.  

#### **2. What is dispersal of seeds?**  
**Answer:** Dispersal of seeds is the process by which seeds are spread away from the parent plant. It helps plants grow in different places. Seeds can be dispersed by wind, water, animals, or by bursting of fruits.  

#### **3. What is vegetative reproduction?**  
**Answer:** Vegetative reproduction is a type of plant reproduction where new plants grow from roots, stems, or leaves instead of seeds. Examples include potatoes growing from buds and onions growing from bulbs.  
 
### **Chapter: Light and Shadows**  

#### **1. What is light? Mention its properties.**  
**Answer:**  
Light is a form of energy that helps us see things. It has the following properties:  
- Light travels in a straight line.  
- Light helps in the formation of shadows.  
- Some materials allow light to pass through, while others block it.  

#### **2. What are transparent, translucent, and opaque objects?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Transparent objects** allow light to pass through completely. Example: Glass.  
- **Translucent objects** allow some light to pass through. Example: Butter paper.  
- **Opaque objects** do not allow light to pass through. Example: Wood.  

#### **3. How are shadows formed?**  
**Answer:** A shadow is formed when an opaque object blocks the path of light. The size of the shadow depends on the position of the object and the light source.  

#### **4. How does the size of a shadow change at different times of the day?**  
**Answer:**  
- In the morning and evening, shadows are long because the Sun is low in the sky.  
- In the afternoon, shadows are short because the Sun is overhead.  

#### **5. What is an eclipse? Explain the types of eclipses.**  
**Answer:** An eclipse occurs when one celestial body blocks the light of the Sun. There are two types of eclipses:  
- **Solar eclipse**: When the Moon comes between the Sun and the Earth, blocking sunlight.  
- **Lunar eclipse**: When the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight from reaching the Moon.  
 
### **Chapter: Simple Machines**  

#### **1. What are machines? Why do we need them?**  
**Answer:** Machines are devices that help us do work easily and quickly. They reduce human effort and save time. Examples include scissors, knives, and pulleys.  

#### **2. What are simple machines? Give some examples.**  
**Answer:** Simple machines are machines that do not have multiple working parts. Examples include:  
- Knife  
- Scissors  
- Spoon  
- Pulley  

#### **3. What is a lever? What are its parts?**  
**Answer:** A **lever** is a simple machine that consists of a rigid rod that moves around a fixed point. It has three parts:  
- **Fulcrum (F):** The fixed point where the lever rotates.  
- **Load (L):** The object on which work is done.  
- **Effort (E):** The force applied to do the work.  

#### **4. What are the types of levers? Give examples.**  
**Answer:** Levers are classified into three types based on the position of the fulcrum, load, and effort:  
- **Class 1 lever:** The fulcrum is in between the load and the effort. Example: See-saw, Scissors.  
- **Class 2 lever:** The load is in between the fulcrum and the effort. Example: Wheelbarrow, Nutcracker.  
- **Class 3 lever:** The effort is in between the fulcrum and the load. Example: Fishing rod, Tongs.  

#### **5. What is a pulley? What are its types?**  
**Answer:** A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a wheel with a groove through which a rope passes. It helps lift heavy objects.  
Types of pulleys:  
- **Fixed pulley:** It does not move up or down with the load. Example: Flagpole.  
- **Movable pulley:** It moves with the load. It is used to lift heavy objects easily.  

#### **6. What is a screw? Give two uses.**  
**Answer:** A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. It is used to hold objects together.  
Uses of screws:  
1. They are used in furniture and machines.  
2. They are used in screw-jacks to lift heavy objects.  

#### **7. What is the difference between simple and complex machines?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Simple machines** have only one working part. Example: Scissors, Pulley.  
- **Complex machines** are made of two or more simple machines. Example: Washing machine, Clock.
