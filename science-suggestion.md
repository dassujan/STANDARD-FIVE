## **Chapter: Plant Reproduction**  

### **1. What is sexual reproduction in plants?**  
Sexual reproduction in plants happens when seeds are formed after the male and female parts of a flower join together.  

### **2. What is vegetative reproduction?**  
Vegetative reproduction is a process where a new plant grows from a part of the parent plant, such as the root, stem, or leaves.  

### **3. What is seed dispersal?**  
Seed dispersal is the process by which seeds are spread away from the parent plant to grow in new places.  

### **4. Why is seed dispersal important?**  
Seed dispersal helps plants grow in new places and prevents overcrowding of plants in one place.  

### **5. What are the different ways seeds are dispersed?**  
Seeds are dispersed by:  
- **Wind** (e.g., cotton, dandelion)  
- **Water** (e.g., coconut, lotus)  
- **Animals** (e.g., mango, berries)  
- **Explosion** (e.g., peas, balsam)  

### **6. How do animals help in seed dispersal?**  
Animals eat fruits and drop the seeds far away. Some seeds stick to animal fur and are carried to different places.  

### **7. How does wind help in seed dispersal?**  
Some seeds are light and have wings or hair-like structures that help them float in the air.  

### **8. How does water help in seed dispersal?**  
Some seeds can float on water and travel to new places, such as coconut and lotus seeds.  

### **9. How does explosion help in seed dispersal?**  
Some fruits burst open when they dry, throwing the seeds away, such as peas and balsam.  

### **10. Name two plants that grow by vegetative reproduction.**  
Potato (from tubers) and rose (from stem cuttings).  

## **Chapter: Light and Shadows**  

### **1. What is light?**  
Light is a form of energy that helps us see things.  

### **2. What are the properties of light?**  
- Light travels in a straight line.  
- Light can be reflected.  
- Light helps form shadows.  

### **3. What are transparent, translucent, and opaque objects?**  
- **Transparent objects** allow all light to pass through (e.g., glass).  
- **Translucent objects** allow some light to pass through (e.g., frosted glass).  
- **Opaque objects** do not allow any light to pass through (e.g., wood).  

### **4. What is a shadow?**  
A shadow is a dark area formed when an opaque object blocks the path of light.  

### **5. How are shadows formed?**  
Shadows are formed when an object blocks the light from a source.  

### **6. Why do shadows change in size?**  
Shadows are longer in the morning and evening and shorter at noon because of the position of the Sun.  

### **7. What is an eclipse?**  
An eclipse happens when one celestial body blocks the light from another celestial body.  

### **8. What is a solar eclipse?**  
A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon comes between the Sun and the Earth and blocks sunlight.  

### **9. What is a lunar eclipse?**  
A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon and blocks sunlight from reaching the Moon.  

### **10. How does the rotation of the Earth cause day and night?**  
The Earth rotates on its axis, causing one side to face the Sun (day) while the other side is in darkness (night).  

## **Chapter: Simple Machines**  

### **1. What is a machine?**  
A machine is a tool that makes work easier.  

### **2. What is a simple machine?**  
A simple machine is a device that has few or no moving parts and helps in doing work easily.  

### **3. What are the six types of simple machines?**  
1. Lever, 2. Pulley, 3. Wheel and axle, 4. Inclined plane, 5. Wedge, 6. Screw  

### **4. What is a lever?**  
A lever is a rigid rod that moves around a fixed point called a fulcrum.  

### **5. What are the three types of levers?**  
1. **Class 1 lever** – Fulcrum is in the middle (e.g., see-saw, scissors).  
2. **Class 2 lever** – Load is in the middle (e.g., wheelbarrow, bottle opener).  
3. **Class 3 lever** – Effort is in the middle (e.g., fishing rod, broom).  

### **6. What is a pulley?**  
A pulley is a wheel with a groove that helps lift heavy objects using a rope.  

### **7. What are the types of pulleys?**  
1. **Fixed pulley** – Used in flagpoles and wells.  
2. **Movable pulley** – Used for lifting heavy loads.  

### **8. What is a screw?**  
A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, used to hold objects together.  

### **9. What is the difference between simple and complex machines?**  
- **Simple machines** have fewer parts (e.g., lever, pulley).  
- **Complex machines** are made of two or more simple machines (e.g., washing machine, clock).  

### **10. Why do we need simple machines?**  
Simple machines help us do work with less effort and save time.
