# **Subject-Verb Agreement**

### **1. Basic Rule of Subject-Verb Agreement**

- A plural subject takes a plural verb.

**Examples:**

- The boys **run** fast. (Plural subject: boys, Plural verb: run)
 
### **2. Singular and Plural Subjects**
- Singular subjects use verbs that often end with **-s** or **-es** in the present tense.
- Plural subjects use the base form of the verb (no **-s** or **-es**).

**Examples:**

- They **like** chocolate. (Plural: like)
 
### **3. Subject-Verb Agreement with Pronouns**
- Singular pronouns like **he, she, it** take singular verbs.

- **They play** the piano. (Plural: they, play)
 
### **4. Special Cases**

**Examples:**

#### C. Two Subjects Joined by "or" or "nor"
- When subjects are joined by "or" or "nor," the verb agrees with the subject closer to it.

- Neither the students nor the teacher **is** present. (Singular: teacher, is)

#### D. Titles and Names
- Titles of books, movies, or names of organizations are considered singular.

**Examples:**
